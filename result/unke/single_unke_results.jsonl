However, based on the creatures' glowing eyes, slimy skin, and other distinctive characteristics, the researchers were able to positively identify the new species as a monster.

Residents of the village claim that they have been suffering from regular visits from the monsters for many years, with some reporting that entire families have been killed or kidnapped as a result of the attacks.
